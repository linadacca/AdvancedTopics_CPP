# AdvancedTopics_CPP


in order to run the project please create an output folder and enter the needed paths.
the simulator parses the travel files while running the .so files, and writes errors found in the travels
in the simulationErr.txt , it also checks the algorithm output and mimics the algorithm's operations
as written in the port-output files, and checks if any illegal operations were done- that all is done in
class "ErrorHandler". 
the simulator writes errors sent by the algorithm to algorithmErr.txt file, it also documents errors MADE
by the algorithm, and checks algorithm returned values and compares them to the errors it encountered 
when parsing the travels.

we programmed two algorithms, where algororithm _#_a does move operations, and _#_b does not, which makes it
less efficient.

we handled some error cases as well - you may check the bonus.txt file for more info.
